    <h1>Travis' Experiences in CS-290</h1>

    <strong>Assignment Zero</strong> (September 23rd, 2016)
    <p>This assignment has been pretty straight-forward. I'm already familiar with HTML's syntax, and I have past experience with git (and GitHub), so this has been a refresher more than anything. I feel like writing the content for my profile in index.html (and this post) has been the main effort. I'm really glad that we'll be using git in this course, and this is my first time using GitHub Classroom, so it'll be interesting to see how that fares. From what I've seen glancing at Piazza, it looks like a valuable resource, and I like the Q&A functionality. I do kind of wish this course had some amount of presence in Canvas, mostly because all of my other courses are (and I like being able to see all of my due dates there), but I'll get over it. I can't say I have a lot of experience with Canvas, so I'm not sure how it's discussion/chat stuff compares to Piazza.</p>
