    <strong>Assignment Zero</strong> (September 23rd, 2016)
    <p>This assignment has been pretty straight-forward. I'm already familiar with HTML's syntax, and I have past experience with git (and GitHub), so this has been a refresher more than anything. I feel like writing the content for my profile in index.html (and this post) has been the main effort. I'm really glad that we'll be using git in this course, and this is my first time using GitHub Classroom, so it'll be interesting to see how that fares. From what I've seen glancing at Piazza, it looks like a valuable resource, and I like the Q&A functionality. I do kind of wish this course had some amount of presence in Canvas, mostly because all of my other courses are (and I like being able to see all of my due dates there), but I'll get over it. I can't say I have a lot of experience with Canvas, so I'm not sure how it's discussion/chat stuff compares to Piazza.</p>

    <strong>Assignment One</strong> (October 10th, 2016)
    <p>This one took me a while, but it was rewarding. Being forced to come up with the CSS to match the mockups required me to actually think about what I'm doing, and learn what I didn't know but needed to. There were times when I felt like I was throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks, but I sorted everything out over time. One thing I was slightly unclear about was how big things should be; I wasn't completely sure whether the mockups were meant to be to scale, and when I made elements the same size, they seemed pretty big. But my site matches the mockups pretty well, so I'm not too worried. I'll style this code blog eventually, but I'm too busy for that for the time being.</p>

    <strong>Assignment Two</strong> (October 21st, 2016)
    <p>This assignment was pretty easy, and took me a lot less time than Assignment One. JavaScript was pretty easy to pick up, and I just searched online if there was anything I needed to do that I couldn't remember from lecture. I frequently found myself on various pages on W3 and the Mozilla Developer Network.

    <strong>Assignment Three</strong> (November 8th, 2016)
    <p>I enjoyed this assignment. I started off by hardcoding in the filenames, just to make sure I had the server working properly. I later updated it to read in files based on the requested URL, if they exist. I did have to look up error handling (in the event that the file didn't exist), and I also googled for key-value pairs to store the loaded files, only to realize I could just access an array with the key (the filename) to retrieve the file contents. The class notes were a helpful reminder of what we covered during lecture.</p>
