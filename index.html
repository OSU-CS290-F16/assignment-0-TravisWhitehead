    <h1>Travis Whitehead</h1>
    <img src="face.jpg">
    <p><b>Major:</b> Computer Science</p>
    <p><b>Year of study:</b> Sophomore (Although it's my first year at OSU, I just transferred here from CCC.)</p>
    <p><b>Confidence in my web development skills:</b> 5. Not a lot of experience, but I'm confident I can accomplish whatever I need to using a search engine and the resources at my disposal.</p>
    <p><b>What I hope to gain from this class:</b> I'd like to get more experience working with HTML, CSS, and javascript. I'm also hoping to gain a better understanding of the problems and obstacles web developers face, how to approach solving them, and how they differ from those of desktop application development. I'm particularly interested in problems surrounding security and user authentication.</p>
    <p><b>Whether I've signed up for Piazza:</b> Of course I have.</p>
    <p><b>Description of the most unique experience I've had:</b> I know travel isn't all that unique, but I don't travel/vacation much, and this was my first time leaving the country: In high school I had the privilege of attending a trip to Japan with a small group of other students. (We were all studying Japanese as our mandatory foreign langauge.) We spent a week traveling and sight-seeing, and then two weeks doing home-stays with Japanese students from our exchange school in K≈çchi. My main take-away was how appreciative I am of the differences between American and Japanese public education. (We have a lot more flexibility in the courses we can choose in school, and our futures do not hinge as heavily on standardized testing.)
